Introducing the PIG Game:

PIG is a thrilling dice game where players compete to be the first to reach a target score, usually set at 100 points. Each turn, players roll a six-sided die and accumulate points. However, rolling a 1 wipes out all points for that turn. Balancing risk and reward is key as players decide when to hold and when to roll. It's a game of chance and strategy that guarantees endless fun for players of all ages. Are you ready to roll the dice and become the ultimate PIG champion? Let the games begin!
